	      <p class="style1"><strong><em>When I select the main Road Network game object a crossing prefab gets selected</em></strong></p>
          <p class="style1">This will happen after you created a new crossing prefab and instantiated it in the scene. Make sure to finalize it when you are ready tweaking it. You can do that by clicking the <strong>Exit Prefab Editor</strong> button in the Inspector or by clicking one of the toolbar tabs at the top in the Inspector. You will be asked to save changes to the prefab if there are changes. Afterwards the main <strong>Road Network</strong> game object will be  selected automatically. As long as the new crossing prefab is not completed. this prefab will be  selected when selecting the main <strong>Road Network</strong> game object.          </p>
          <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Roundabouts are not correctly instnatiated and connected to the first or last marker of a road</em></strong> </p>
<p class="style1">For now avoid instantiating a roundabout directly to the first or last marker of the selected road. Instead use the other way to Instantiate intersections in the scene, by selecting the crossing prefabs tab <img src="../images/prefabs_tab.jpg" width="53" height="29" style="vertical-align:middle">. Select the roundabout  from the list of available crossing prefabs, hold the SHIFT key and click in the scene where you want to position this roundabout. You can now connect roads to the prefab or start new roads by dragging the red roundabout connection handles. <a href="intersections.html#create" class="link">For full details click here</a>.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>The Roundabout geometry does not update after changing to the radius, resolution or after adding / changing a connection</strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">Before creating/ adding the connections of a roundabout it is recommend to first set the radius and resolution correctly. The number of possible connections depends on the resolution and the radius and the width of the connections. If you make changes to the radius or resolution when connections already exist it could be possible that connections cannot be rebuild. You will see warning messages in the console when this occurs. You can try repositioning connections, starting at connection 1, by carefully checking the white middle handle and outer green handles positions. The green handles turn red when that connection cannot be created because it is either to close to the start or end of the roundabout (the white outer handle at the fixed position) or because it is overlapping another connection. But the easiest way to solve this, is by removing all connections first and then start adding new connections, the geometry of the roundabout will rebuild.</p>
<p class="style1">This will be further optimized, for now it is recommend to avoid this situation by first setting the radius and resolution correctly. In this case the roundabout geometry will only not  rebuild when the currently selected connection overlaps another connection. You can fix this by either changing its position using the position slider or by changing the width of the connection.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Roads connected to a crossing bend to fast affecting the shape of the road</em></strong><em></em></p>
<p class="style1">This will be further optimized, for now, try positioning the first marker nearer to the crossing.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>I can't select road markers outside the terrain boundaries</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">When a marker for some reason is positioned outside the terrain boundaries you can select it by carefully moving towards the marker over the road mesh.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Road marker cannot be attached to crossing connection, the road geometry and the crossing connection geometry matches but the connection shows in red</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">This can happen when sidewalks are active but the outer sidewalk handle is disabled (meaning no sidwalks for the attached road). Select the specific crossing and make sure the outer corner handle is green (active) when the road on that side does include sidewalks.</p>
<p class="style1">This will also happen for custom crossings when the geometry structure of the road does not match the custom crossing connection.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>The terrain is rendered through the road</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">There are two situations when this can happen: </p>
  <p class="style1">First,   the Unity terrain object stores height values in decimals between 0 and   1, meaning it is impossible to apply negative height values. The roads   must be at or above the terrains game object Y position.Also take into   account the nature of spline shapes. When you place two markers (A and   B) exactly on the terrain objects Y position and a third (C) raised a   bit higher, the road shape (spline curve) between A and B will go   slightly below the terrain objects Y position, the terrain will be   rendered above the road in this area because it cannot be pushed lower.<br>
    <br>
    Second,   the Unity terrain object is grid based, it is impossible to add terrain   points for more detail. The bigger the heightmapscale (terrain size vs   heightmap resolution) the less flexible you are with road shapes. Enough   terrain points must be available to adapt the terrain to the road shape   changes in that area. This for example will clearly become visible in   sharp bends with also significant height changes in the bend. Possibly   the same terrain points are used to adapt the terrain to the road height   at position A and the road height at position B which is not good. You   can see this when zooming in and switch the scene view to for example   Texture Wire which will also show the terrain geometry.</p>
  <p class="style1">The   same can happen when roads or road segments are to close to each other,   at least two terrain points  must be between the two roads, one leveled   to road A, the other leveled to road  B. &nbsp;When the same point is used   on both roads it is very likely the terrain will either pop through the   lower road or the higher road floats above the terrain at that position.</p>

<p class="style1">Please contact us if this is not the case in your situation.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>Road type and side object preset names in the Inspector are displayed in characters / numbers and are unreadable</strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">This can happen when Assets Serialization in your Unity project editor settings (Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Editor) is set to &quot;Text&quot; instead of the default setting &quot;Mixed&quot;.</p>
<p class="style1">A workaround to fix this is the following:</p>
<p class="style1">Create a new empty project (Assets Serialization is set to Mixed), import the   package, switch to Force Text and export the full assets folder to a new   package. Import this package in your project that uses Force Text.</p>
<p class="style21">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>I cannot select road markers and/or crossing prefabs</strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">This can happen after instantiating a crossing prefab in the scene. Double click on an empty spot should solve that.</p>
<p class="style21">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style21"><em>The road objects are rendered  black</em></p>
<p class="style1">This will happen in Unity 5 when normal maps are used and no tangent info is available in the generated mesh. Please make sure &quot;Calculate Tangents&quot; is activated in the Build Settings and optionally in General Settings &gt; Scene Settings.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>The Delete key destroys the Road Network game object</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">Since in general the Road Network game object is selected the delete key will target this game object. When the scene view window has focus, pressing the delete key will becaptured and you will be asked for a confirmation. This will work just fine unless the Hierarchy window has focus. So far we have not found a way to capture key events in the hierarchy window, if you have a suggestion it would be very much appreciated to contact us.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>Keyboard shortcuts do not work</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">For actions such as Shift + R (remove the selected marker) please make sure the Scene View window has focus.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><strong><em>The normals at connection points between the road and a custom connection prefab are not smooth</em></strong></p>
<p class="style1">This is most likely due to the geometry structure between the connections as both ends of the road not being identical. Although the road connects well it is possible that there is a difference in normal groups between the two connections. Therefor it is impossible to smooth the normals correctly.</p>
<p class="style1">You may want to double check the smoothing groups in your modelling app. Another reason why this can happen is when using &quot;Calculate&quot; in the import settings of the model. You can verify this by checking the vertex count for the specific mesh asset after clicking &quot;Apply&quot;. Unity will rebuild the mesh based on the selected smoothing angle which will result in a different number of vertices. Another way to check the normal groups is by opening the custom prefab in the Custom Prefab editor window and select the specific connection from the dropdown. The number of normal groups will be listed in the stats window. For exact normal group info you can open the UV editor window and select each node one by one. When the &quot;Hard Edge&quot; checkbox is on a new normal group will start at this node. This is all according the geometry structure of the source mesh.</p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1"><em><strong>I cannot set the Indent values below a certain value</strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">The minimum indent values are based on the terrains  heightmapscale (size vs heightmap resolution). It is required to ensure the best possible terrain deformation according the road shape because the Unity terrain object does not accept additional points to for more detail in certain areas. The bigger the heightmapscale the higher the Min Indent values. </p>
<p class="style1">The default values for each marker match the globally stored Min Indent values in General Settings &gt; Scene Settings.</p>
<p class="style1">So if these Min Indent values are high in your project, this is probably due to your terrain settings.</p>
